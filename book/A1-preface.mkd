Preface
=======
\thispagestyle{empty}

The goal of this book is to provide a basic understanding of
the technical design and architecture of the Internet.
The book is aimed at all audiences -- even those with absolutely no prior
technical experience or math skills.  The Internet is an amazingly beautiful
design and should be understood by all who use it.

While this book is not about the Network+ or CCNA
certifications, I hope it serves as a way to give students
interested in these certifications a good starting point.

I want to thank Pamela Fox of Khan Academy for coming up with
the idea of an introductory network technology course using open
materials.

I initially developed this material as a single week's lecture in
the *SI502 - Networked Computing* course that I taught at the
University of Michigan School of Information starting in 2008.
I refined and expanded the material to be three weeks of the
Internet History, Technology, and Security (IHTS) course
that I have taught to over 100,000 students on Coursera
starting in 2012. This book adds further detail to create a standalone
text that can be read for enjoyment or used to support an introductory course
that focuses on the Internet's architecture.

This book has been particularly fun in that it is a collaboration
with my friends Mauro Toselli (@xlontrax) and Sue Blumenberg.  I met Mauro and
Sue in 2012 when they became volunteer Community Teaching Assistants (CTAs)
for my IHTS course on Coursera.  Over the past three years we have become
friends and colleagues.   It is a great example of how open education
can bring people together.
